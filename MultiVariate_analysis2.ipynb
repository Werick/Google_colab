        "Analysis of multivariate data - NHANES case study\n",
        "In this notebook, we illustrate several basic techniques for exploring data using methods for understanding multivariate relationships. The statistical methods discussed here will parallel the methods discussed in the multivariate methods section of the course, and build on the univariate analysis discussed earlier. As with the univariate notebook, we use here the 2015-2016 wave of the NHANES study for illustration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Many of the analyses presented in this notebook use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization. These are very powerful tools that give you a vast number of options when constructing plots. We will not explain every option to every function in the examples below. You can use the Matplotlib and Seaborn documentation to fully understand the options, and you can experiment with these and other plots on your own to get a better sense of what can be done.\n",

        "Bivariate data arise when every \"unit of analysis\" (e.g. a person in the NHANES dataset) is assessed with respect to two traits (the NHANES subjects were assessed for many more than two traits, but we can consider two traits at a time here).\n",
        "\n",
        "A scatterplot is a very common and easily-understood visualization of quantitative bivariate data. Below we make a scatterplot of arm length against leg length. This means that arm length (BMXARML) is plotted on the vertical axis and leg length (BMXLEG) is plotted on the horizontal axis). We see a positive dependence between the two measures -- people with longer arms tend to have longer legs, and vice-versa. However it is far from a perfect relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a scatterplot with more than around 100 points, \"overplotting\" becomes an issue. This means that many points fall on top of each other in the plot, which obscures relationships in the middle of the distribution and over-emphasizes the extremes. One way to mitigate overplotting is to use an \"alpha\" channel to make the points semi-transparent, as we have done below.\n",

As discussed in the course, the Pearson correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with values approaching 1 indicating a more perfect positive dependence.

        "Below, we continue to probe the relationship between leg length and arm length, stratifying first by gender, then by gender and ethnicity. The gender-stratified plot indicates that men tend to have somewhat longer arms and legs than women -- this is reflected in the fact that the cloud of points on the left is shifted slightly up and to the right relative to the cloud of points on the right.

        "We conclude this section by noting that marital status is associated with many factors, including gender and eduational status, but also varies strongly by age and birth cohort. For example, it is unlikely for young people to be widowed, and it is less likely for older people to be \"never married\", since a person can transition from \"never married\" into one of the other categories, but can never move back. Below we will consider the role of age in more detail, and later in the course we will revisit these questions using more sophisticated analytic methods that can account for all of these factors simultaneously. However, since NHANES is a cross-sectional study, there are certain important questions that it cannot be used to answer. For example, while we know each person's current marital status, we do not know their full marital history (e.g. how many times and at what ages they were married or divorced).\n",

        "Another situation that commonly arises in data analysis is when we wish to analyze bivariate data consisting of one quantitative and one categorical variable. To illustrate methods that can be used in this setting, we consider the relationship between marital status and age in the NHANES data. Specifically, we consider the distribution of ages for people who are currently in each marital status category. A natural tool in this setting is side-by-side boxplots. Here we see some unsurprising things -- widowed people tend to be older, and never-married people tend to be younger.\n",

        "When we have enough data, a \"violinplot\" gives a bit more insight into the shapes of the distributions compared to a traditional boxplot. The violinplot below is based on the same data as the boxplot above. We can see quite clearly that the distributions with low mean (living with partner, never married) are strongly right-skewed, while the distribution with high mean (widowed) is strongly left-skewed. The other distributions have intermediate mean values, and are approximately symmetrically distributed. Note also that the never-married distribution has a long shoulder, suggesting that this distributions includes many people who are never-married because they are young, and have not yet reached the ages when people typically marry, but also a substantial number of people will marry for the first time anywhere from their late 30's to their mid-60's.\n",
